      <h1>What is MedIPred?</h1>
      <p>Integrating deep learning into clinical workflows for medical image
        analysis holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy. However, strict data
        privacy regulations and the sensitivity of clinical IT infrastructure limit the
        deployment of cloud-based solutions. This is WebIPred, a web-
        based application that loads deep learning models directly within the client’s web
        browser, protecting patient privacy while maintaining compatibility with clinical
        IT environments. WebIPred supports the application of pre-trained models
        published on Zenodo and other repositories, allowing clinicians to apply these
        models to real patient data without the need for extensive technical knowledge.
        This paper outlines WebIPred’s model integration system, prediction workflow,
        and privacy features. Our results show that WebIPred offers a privacy-protecting
        and flexible application for image classification, only relying on client-side
        processing. WebIPred combines its strong commitment to data privacy and
        security with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for clinicians to integrate
        AI into their workflows.</p>

        deploying own instances is available within the repository at

      <h2>Dataset and Model Training</h2>
      <p>
        We utilized the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, which consists of anterior-
        posterior chest X-rays of pediatric patients aged one to five years from Guangzhou
        Women and Children’s Medical Center. The dataset contains two classes: NORMAL
        and PNEUMONIA. All images were initially screened for quality control to remove
        low-quality or unreadable scans. Diagnoses were annotated by two expert physicians,
        and a third expert reviewed the evaluation set to account for any grading errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets, and the model was
        trained using the AUCMEDI framework. AUCMEDI has been successfully applied
        to a variety of medical imaging datasets, achieving high classification performance, and demonstrating strong accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and
        pneumonia-affected patients.

      <h2>Application Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        WebIPred is built using the Angular web framework [5] and relies on Tensorflow.js to
        load and apply pre-trained deep learning classifiers. The application runs entirely in the
        web browser, ensuring no patient data is transmitted to external servers. The web
        application is set up to download the trained model from Zenodo, a platform for
        sharing and preserving research data, including deep learning models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tensorflow.js requires the deep learning models to be stored in TensorFlow.js
        Layers format. This specific format consists of a JSON file that defines the model's
        architecture and a set of binary files containing the model's weights. Through Zenodo
        the models are provided in a compressed format (zip) to reduce the transmission load.
        This requires decompression within the web browser using the Javascript library JSZip.
        Once loaded, models are applied to medical images selected by the user, with all
        processing handled client-side through dedicated process workers. Angular web
        workers are a mechanism in Angular that allows for offloading CPU-intensive tasks to
        a separate thread, improving application performance and maintaining responsiveness.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-4 card m-3 p-3">
      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        The primary design goal of WebIPred is to conform to stringent data protection
        regulations, such as GDPR in Europe, which impose strict limitations on how patient
        data can be handled. To achieve this, all image data is processed locally in the browser.
        WebIPred does not store any data on servers, and once a session is closed, all data -
        images, predictions, and model metadata - is deleted from the browser’s memory. This
        architecture ensures that sensitive medical data remains secure, and there is no risk of
        data leakage to third-party servers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-4 card m-3 p-3">
      <h2>Model Management and Loading</h2>
      <p>
        WebIPred supports a wide range of pre-trained models available from Zenodo or other
        repositories. These models must be compatible with the Tensorflow.js format. Users
        can filter models based on specific needs, and once selected, the model’s binary files
        are loaded into the browser’s runtime memory. The loaded model can then be applied
        to patient images, generating predictions directly on the client’s device.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-4 card m-3 p-3">
      <h2>Prediction Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        WebIPred is designed to be user-friendly, even for clinicians with limited technical
        expertise. The prediction process is guided through a three-step form.

              After confirming the selected model and
              images, WebIPred processes the images, generating class probabilities for
              each image. Results are visualized using bar charts and tabulated data and can
              be exported as CSV files for further analysis.

<ng-template #faq1>
  <p>
    This application allows for medical image classification in the web browser.
    To get started, you need an image and a backend that holds trained models
    that fit your use case.
  </p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template #faq2>
  <p>
    Prediction happens in your web browser. That means, images you select for
    prediction never leave your device.
